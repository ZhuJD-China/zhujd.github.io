            <p>In a recent paper, Facebook and University of California, Berkeley researchers propose an approach to
                payload-carrying drone flight planning that “learns how to learn” models of environmental dynamics.
                Results from experiments suggest the work could inform the development of future robots — perhaps in
                warehouses or other industrial settings — that physically interact with and adapt to the world in the
                face of unpredictability.</p>

            <p>The team used meta-learning, a subfield of machine learning where learning algorithms are applied on
                metadata about machine learning experiments, to train a model for fast adaptation to changing dynamics
                in the context of a suspended payload control task. In this task, a quadcopter had to position itself to
                pick up a target object along a path to a goal destination.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest challenges stemmed from the variability different payloads introduced, all of which
                were attached via cable and a magnetic gripper. For example, a payload with a shorter cable oscillated
                faster compared with one attached with a longer cable.</p>

            <p>To address this, the team trained a dynamics model with data from a range of physical conditions, like
                different payload masses and tether lengths, and augmented it with variables representing unknown
                environmental and task factors. This enabled the system to adapt to new payloads at test time by
                initializing the dynamics model, getting the current state, solving for an action, executing that
                action, recording the outcome, and then retraining the dynamics model.</p>

            <p>The researchers collected the initial training data by having a person pilot the quadcopter (a DJI Tello)
                along random paths for each different suspended payload. (The payloads in question were 3D-printed boxes
                weighing between 10 and 15 grams.) Data including the controls and location of the payload, tracked with
                an
                externally mounted RGB camera, was recorded every 0.25 seconds and saved into a data set consisting of
                separate data sets — one per payload task.</p>

            <p>The final corpus consisted of approximately 16,000 data points from 1.1 hours of flight, 5% of which was
                reserved for evaluation.</p>

            <p>In the course of the experiments, the researchers reported, the quadcopter delivered payloads to their
                destinations the majority of the time. That said, they acknowledged there’s room for improvement; the
                time
                the suspended payload was picked up or dropped off had to be manually specified, and the approach only
                assumed an estimate of the suspended payload’s position. They left overcoming those challenges to future
                work.</p>

            <p>“We believe this is the first meta-learning approach demonstrated on a real-world quadcopter using only
                real-world training data that successfully shows improvement in closed-loop performance compared to
                non-adaptive methods for suspended payload transportation,” wrote the researchers. “Although we only
                consider the specific task of quadcopter payload transportation in this work, we note that our method is
                general and is applicable to any robotic system that interact with the environment under changing
                conditions.”</p>
